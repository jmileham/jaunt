## Description

Everyone communicates online these days, but we're usually limited to talking to people that speak the same language as us. Jauntt is a chat service that automatically translates everyones text into your language. Select Spanish as your language, type "Hola. ¿Cómo está todos?", and it will be translated into French, Spanish, German, Arabic, Russian, etc. - into any and every language that users in the room have selected. Language barriers virtually disappear. The same conversation happens in many different languages at once. Jauntt makes it really easy to talk to just about anyone.


### Use Case: Communication
You want to talk to your penpal in his native tongue? No hay problema! Each of you set your native language and you'll be conversing fluidly in no-time. Share your room link to spread the fun.

**ProTip**: Hover your mouse over a message to see the source language and the original text.

### Use Case: Education
Can't find any French speakers who'll chat with you? Pas de problème. Set your mode to "French" and then watch as all your friends' messages are displayed en français. Practicing to learn a foreign language is as easy as talking with your next door neighbor.

**ProTip**: If you prepend your message with "###", you'll get a suprise.
